        <h1>Get to know me:</h1>    
        <p>Hi there! My name is Rufaro, and I'm from Zimbabwe. I am currently pursuing a BSc Computer Science degree at <a href = "https://www.uwc.ac.za/">University of the Western Cape</a>, Cape Town and a dream of pioneering and revolutionising tech solutions to underserved communities. 
        <br>I'd describe myself as passionate, witty and a little bit of a dreamer. A random fact about me? I am a jack of all trades but unfortunately a master of none. </p>
        <p>In my free time, I love to watch series and brainstorm new ideas. Recently, I've been getting more into web development and I am excited to learn more stuff as time moves.</p>
