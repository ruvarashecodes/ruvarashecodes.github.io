    <h1>Rufaro's Space!!</h1>
    <h3>Hi, I'm Rufaro! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, projects and a bit of everything else!</h3>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a BSc Computer Science degree at <a href = "https://www.uwc.ac.za/">University of the Western Cape</a>, Cape Town. I started this site when as way to get into Web Development and what better way to learn than by doing. <br> 
    Its just me and my basic html skills against the world but by the time this is done I would have learned a lot. I am excited and cannot wait to show off my skills (which I currently do not posses).  </p>
